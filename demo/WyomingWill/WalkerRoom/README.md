# Walker room

All twelve walkers from `../Walkers/` on one meadow, each scaled so its
footprint is about 40 cm, walking freely inside a walled 10 m x 10 m
arena. Open `walker-room.lua`.

Each walker is built by its own `../Walkers/<name>_parts.lua`, the same
code its standalone file uses, so it walks in the room as it does on its
own. Its gravity is scaled with it, so it moves as it does full size.
All of them share one world, one terrain and one physics step (1/960 s).

When a walker comes within one body length (40 cm) of a wall, or of
another walker ahead of it, it turns smoothly (over a second) to a new
heading pointing away from what is near. The balanced 2-leg Spears is held to
move only along its heading, so it turns only in right angles. A walker
that falls over and stays down for 2 seconds is stood up again, facing
the way it was facing, and carries on.

## Keys

Click the 3D view first so it has keyboard focus.

| Key       | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tab       | Follow the next walker |
| Shift+Tab | Follow the one before |
| O         | Look over the whole room |
| T         | Clear the trails |
| Mouse     | Turn and zoom the view (it keeps following) |

Rest the pointer on a walker, or on a trail, to see whose it is, how far
it has gone and how often it has turned or been stood up.

## Slider

| Slider        | Range     | What it does |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| TerrainHeight | 0 to 8 cm | How high the bumps are. The room is built again, every walker back at its start, when you let go. |

The point of the room: raise the bumps until some walkers can't cover
ground any more.

## Trails

## Settings for a launcher

A script that sets these globals and then runs `walker-room.lua` changes
the room: `ARENA` (side, cm, 1000), `CELL` (terrain cell, cm, 4), `AMP`
(starting bump height, cm, 1), `SEED` (starting headings and turns, 1),
`ONLY` (build just the walker of that name), `WALKERS_DIR` (where the
parts files are, `../Walkers/`).
